It is theorized that a possible dark matter interaction could be seen by utilizing atomic clocks onboard GPS satellites.Our role was to Data mine freely available GPS data that goes back as far as 14 years (for 32 satellites).We created a searching algorithm that would sift through the data and attempt to find a specific signal generated by a dark matter thin-wall model.My focus also included the noise profiles of atomic clocks and testing the sensitivity of our searchin order to provide an accurate analysis of the data.The research I did was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Nevada Undergraduate Research Award",link:"If you are interested in our work, you can read our paper here: ",poster:"You can also view the poster I presented at the Undergraduate Research Symposium at the University of Nevada Reno:"},{title:"National Security Technologies",description:"Worked with the Flash X-ray Accelerator (FXR) research group in Livermore, California.Created new features, while optimizing existing features for image-processing software.The goal was to process and analyze calibration radiographic images in order to get real-time feedback and help calibrate the FXR.",poster:"If you are interested in the concepts behind the calibration take a look at the posterthat I presented at the Livermore National Labs: "}]}},created:function(){var e=this;this.$http.get("https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/users/101671443483721840964/bookshelves/1001/volumes?&key=AIzaSyCmE5LBl8ScivGDV9650Avd4qkfF7ixsxA").then(function(t){e.books=t.body.items.splice(0,3),console.log(t.body)})}}},function(e,t){},function(e,t){},function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/img/Moon3.8ec15cc.jpg"},function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/img/Orion.79dc7cd.jpg"},function(e,t,a){function i(e){a(9)}var s=a(1)(a(7),a(14),i,"data-v-5e19bb5c",null);e.exports=s.exports},function(e,t){e.exports={render:function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("div",{attrs:{id:"app"}},[a("router-view")],1)},staticRenderFns:[]}},function(e,t,a){e.exports={render:function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("body",[e._m(0),e._v(" "),a("div",{staticClass:"section black"},[a("div",{staticClass:"row"},[e._m(1),e._v(" "),a("div",{staticClass:"col s6"},[a("h1",{staticClass:"center-align",staticStyle:{color:"white"}},[e._v("Reading List")]),e._v(" "),a("div",{staticClass:"readinglist"},[a("div",{staticClass:"center-align",attrs:{id:"readingList"}},[e._l(e.books,function(t){return a("ul",{staticClass:"left-align",staticStyle:{color:"white"}},[a("img",{staticStyle:{width:"128px",height:"128px"},attrs:{src:t.volumeInfo.imageLinks.smallThumbnail}}),e._v("\n                "+e._s(t.volumeInfo.title)+" -- by\n                "+e._s(t.volumeInfo.authors[0])+"\n              ")])}),e._v(" "),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://books.google.com/books?uid=101671443483721840964&as_coll=1001&source=gbs_lp_bookshelf_list"}},[e._v("Check out the rest of my bookshelf")])],2)])])])]),e._v(" "),e._m(2),e._v(" "),a("div",{staticClass:"section white"},[a("div",{staticClass:"row"},e._l(e.cards,function(t){return a("ul",{staticClass:"collapsible popout",attrs:{"data-collapsible":"expandable"}},[a("li",[a("div",{staticClass:"collapsible-header"},[a("h2",{staticClass:"center-align"},[e._v(e._s(t.title))])]),e._v(" "),a("div",{staticClass:"collapsible-body"},[a("div",{staticClass:"center-align"},[e._v("\n                  "+e._s(t.description)+"\n                ")])])])])}))])])},staticRenderFns:[function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,i=e._self._c||t;return i("div",{staticClass:"parallax-container"},[i("div",{staticClass:"parallax"},[i("img",{attrs:{src:a(11)}})])])},function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("div",{staticClass:"col s6"},[a("h1",{staticClass:"center-align",staticStyle:{color:"white"}},[e._v("Wyatt Williams")]),e._v(" "),a("p",{staticClass:"center-align",staticStyle:{color:"white"}},[e._v("Hi, I'm Wyatt Williams.
